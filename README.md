# Bosch Target Charts
**Target Charts** is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows Bosch to easily manage and visualize their business and production targets. It was created by our team of senior Computer Science majors at the College of Charleston in collaboration with Mr. David Stamps and Mr. Charles Bolin of Bosch Charleston as part of our senior capstone seminar course at the College of Charleston.

We recommend visiting our Wiki for installation guides and more about Target Charts.
